  1: `Help me identify my ideal client and their biggest limitation for a No-Phone Offer. Interview me with one question at a time. After enough info, create an Ideal Client Profile. Focus on: who they are, their specific situation, and the thorn in their paw.`,
  
  2: `Help me create my Solutions Inventory. Ask about my existing products/services and organize them into three buckets: CLARITY (trainings, courses, frameworks), PLAN (roadmaps, workbooks, blueprints), and INTEGRATION split into DIY (templates, scripts), DWY (coaching, calls), and DFY (done for them). Ask one question at a time.`,
  
  3: `Help me score my limitations using the Thorn in the Paw scorecard. For each limitation, I need to rate: To-Do List frequency (Daily=3, Weekly=2, Monthly=1), Mind Share (worry frequency), Emotional Temperature (High Fever=3, Warm=2, Cold=0), TAI - do they talk about it (Yes=1, No=0), and Hard to Find Solution (Hard=3, Med=2, Easy=1). Help me identify which limitation scores highest.`,
  
  4: `Help me craft my Outcome Statement using the formula: [Number] + [Specific Result] + [Timeframe] + [Optional Method]. Start with my limitation, flip it, make it measurable, add timeframe, make it more specific, test believability, then simplify. Push me toward measurable, tangible outcomes.`,
  
  5: `Help me build my 3-Step Roadmap. Ask about my outcome and help me identify the 3 critical pillars. Put them in chronological order. Each phase should be desirable on its own. Follow the pattern: Create/Build → System to Sell/Deliver → Traffic/Scale.`,
  
  6: `Help me choose my Delivery Model. Start by asking if I can do things FOR them (DFY has highest value). Then figure out DWY support level. Then DIY components. Ask about my capacity and what I enjoy delivering. Optionally help create self-sorting options (max 2).`,
  
  7: `Help me price my No-Phone Offer. Start with: what do I want to be paid? Then help structure the payment for lowest friction. Consider: one-time below $2K, weekly payments, first payment + performance, payment plans. Remind me about ascension thinking and backend value.`,
  
  8: `Help me finalize my No-Phone Offer document. Review what I've built across all steps and help me write it in the Google Doc format: Story (if cold traffic) → Outcome → Roadmap → Delivery → Pricing → Bonuses/FAQ → Scarcity. Add transition sentences, motivational copy, and "so that you can" language.`,
