export const DM_SCRIPT_PROMPT = `Based on the following No-Phone Offer details, generate a complete DM script following the proven structure:

1. **Personal Greeting**: Warm, use their name
2. **Limited Opportunity (Scarcity)**: "I'm opening the doors for [X number] [ideal client description], and will [offer in one sentence]"
3. **Specific Outcome + Timeframe**: "Within [timeframe], [specific result]"
4. **Social Proof Suggestion**: Suggest what kind of screenshot/proof to include
5. **Soft CTA**: "I have a Google Doc with all the deets. Want to take a look?"

Also generate:
- A follow-up message if they don't respond
- A response for when they say "yes"
- A response for when they ask questions

Keep it conversational, warm, and low-pressure. The DM should make them curious about the Google Doc, not sell on the spot.`;
